Hi, welcome to my blog. I primarily write about topics related to data science, software development, and artificial intelligence. Here, I share my experiences and thoughts on the new tools I explore. However, I also enjoy sharing my everyday life experiences and the things I learn. Recently, I relocated to Bangalore, away from my family. Oh, how I miss them!

I believe this space allows me to express myself and share my thoughts with anyone who is interested. I am eager to learn from my readers and would appreciate their comments on any of my posts. While I started blogging back in 2020, using platforms like fastpages and Medium, I have now shifted to Quarto, and I am already loving it!

I could have considered other various ways to express myself, such as Instagram reels or live streams. However, I believe that words hold a greater sense of power and confidence. There's something fulfilling about writing and publishing my thoughts. Hence, on this day, I am embarking on a fresh start of my blogging journey with this new web page of mine.
