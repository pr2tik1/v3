Hi! I am Pratik. I am a software engineer specializing in solving complex data problems and I love to develop tools and web applications. Currently, I work at **Elucidata**, where I leverage cutting-edge technology and tools to drive impactful outcomes. With a strong background in data science and web development, I have completed numerous successful projects. When I am not coding, I am probably at the gym or playing football. I led my team in college football tournaments and had a wonderful time participating in college sports.

I love movies and one of the quotes that I live by is,

>  *If you want something very badly, set it free. If it comes back to you, it's yours forever. If it doesn't, it was never yours to begin with.* <br><br> - Indecent Proposal (1993)
